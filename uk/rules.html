<p>ARTICLE 1 - ORGANISER</p>
<p>MarketLuck, a simplified joint-stock company with share capital of €150,000, registered in the Paris Trade and Companies Register under number 803 829 688 and whose registered office is situated at 13-15 Avenue de la Métallurgie, 93200, Saint-Denis, France (hereinafter “MarketLuck”), is the publisher of an application for smartphones and tablets (hereinafter “the Application”).</p>
<p>Through this application, MarketLuck organises “Bravospeed”, a free game with no obligation to purchase (hereinafter the “Game”).</p>
<p>All trademarks, logos and other distinctive signs reproduced in the Application are the exclusive property of MarketLuck or of its partners. Accordingly, they are protected by the provisions of the French Intellectual Property Code. Any unauthorised reproduction of these trademarks, logos or signs constitutes an infringement liable to criminal prosecution.</p>
<p>Apple is not a sponsor and has no involvement in the prizes advertised. The prizes have no connection with Apple products.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 2 - TERMS OF PARTICIPATION - REGISTRATION</p>
<p>2.1 Terms of Participation</p>
<p>Any natural person of legal age, resident in United Kingdom, Metropolitan France, a French overseas department, a French overseas territory, Belgium, Switzerland, Spain, Germany, Austria with the exception of MarketLuck employees and their family members, may register and play via the Application (hereinafter the “Participant”).</p>
<p>All persons registered on the Application acknowledge that they have read and understood these rules and undertake to comply with them in full.</p>
<p>2.2 Registration</p>
<p>No registration is required to participate in the Game.</p>
<p>Each Participant shall be identified on the basis of the smartphone or tablet of which they acknowledge themselves to be the regular user.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 3 - GAME DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>For each Participant, the Game consists of playing a ticket, namely of selecting and saving, in a ticket containing 65 numbers:</p>

<ul><li>5 “Speed” numbers</li>
<li>3 “Bonus” numbers</li>
</ul>

<p>after having viewed advertising content.</p>
<p>Once a ticket has been saved, the player must “submit” it in order for that ticket to be taken into account by the application in the next draw. A button is provided to this effect in several locations within the application, including the home page.</p>
<p>This allows the player to save multiple tickets and submit them all at once for the next programmed draw.</p>
<p>The draw consists of a randomised draw of 7 “Speed” balls, followed by 3 “Bonus” balls, out of a total of 65 balls. The winning combinations are drawn at random. Each Participant who has selected one of the winning combinations wins the highest prize associated with the numbers and signs that they have entered.</p>
<p>For example, a Participant who has entered 3 correct Speed numbers and 2 correct Bonus numbers:</p>

<ul><li>shall only win the prize corresponding to the “Three Speed numbers and two Bonus numbers” combination;</li>
<li>and shall not win the prize corresponding to the “Two Speed numbers and two Bonus numbers” combination, nor that corresponding to the “Two Speed numbers and one Bonus number” combination.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are four types of draw in Bravospeed: Bronze, Silver, Gold and Diamond.</p>
<p>In order to play one of these draws, the player must use a ticket that is specific to that draw.</p>
<p>For example, if the player wishes to play the “Diamond” draw, they must have a “Diamond” ticket.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 4 - HOW THE GAME WORKS</p>
<p>The Participant opens the Application and plays a ticket. They will then view advertising content, for example, a video. Videos shall not exceed 3 minutes. Once the advertising content has been viewed, the ticket played by the Participant is validated.</p>
<p>Certain tickets can be validated without the player having viewed an advertisement, in particular, the “Bronze” tickets. The frequency of advertisements is at the discretion of the Organiser.</p>
<p>The Participant may play from Monday to Sunday. The Participant may play as many times as they choose, within a limit of 100 tickets per draw.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 5 - DRAWS</p>
<p>The timetable for the different draws is available in the Application.</p>
<p>The results of a draw are known a maximum of 1 hour after it has taken place.</p>
<p>Draws are performed under the supervision of the compliance officer’s office of SCP SIMONIN-LE MAREC-GUERRIER, 54 rue Taitbout, 75009, Paris</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>9.1 General rules</p>
<p>To receive the prize, the winner must have completed their player profile in the application: surname, first name, home address, date of birth, email address (and telephone number, optional).</p>
<p>To receive payment, the winner will be directed to our payment tool where the following information will be requested from them: information to be completed in the payment tool: photograph of the winner's bank account details and ID (identity card, driving licence, passport), IBAN and photograph of the winner with permission to use it on all of Bravospeed's platforms (on the Application, Facebook, Instagram, etc.).</p>
<p>Marketluck may also require a testimonial video from the winner for amounts greater than or equal to £85.</p>
<p>All this information is mandatory and must be provided within 30 days of the date of winning in order to be able to verify the winner's identity and to make the bank payment.</p>
<p>Payment shall be made once the identity of the winner and compliance with these clauses have been verified. In the event of cheating or attempt of cheating (the use of an ad blocker for example) Marketluck reserves the right to invalidate the win.</p>
<p>Winners shall receive confirmation of their prize in the form of a “push” notification via the Application.</p>
<p>Any Participant who has won a cash prize of £450 or more will be contacted directly by telephone and by email by the Bravospeed team who will detail the stages required for the payment to be made correctly and smoothly.</p>
<p>Any Participant who has won a cash prize of less than £450 must inform the Bravospeed team by completing their profile on the payment tool and providing the documentary evidence specified above.</p>

<p>Winners shall receive the Voucher corresponding to their prize via the Application.</p>
<p>This Voucher must be used within 30 days of receipt. Vouchers that remain unused within this period shall be permanently expired and shall not come back into play.</p>
<p>By way of exception, certain Vouchers must be used within a shorter period. These periods shall be indicated under the “Prizes” tab in the Application. Any such period takes precedence over those stipulated within these rules.</p>
<p>In addition, only one Discount Voucher may be used per payment.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 10 - PRIZE STORE</p>

<p>A “discount voucher” is understood to mean a voucher that entitles the owner to a discount, subject to a minimum purchase.</p>
<p>Speed Points can be accumulated from multiple draws. The player may choose when to use them, provided that they have enough Speed Points to receive their chosen prize.</p>
<p>Photographs or graphical representations of Vouchers are for illustrative purposes only and are not contractually binding.</p>
<p>In the event that it is impossible to provide a Voucher identical to the one advertised on the Application when the Game was organised, MarketLuck reserves the right to substitute said Voucher with an equivalent gift, and the winner shall not be entitled to claim any damages whatsoever.</p>
